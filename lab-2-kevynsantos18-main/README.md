In this lab we made a simple calculator that does addition, subtraction, and multiplication. We use two 4-bit binary inputs. We use 8 switches total for this. To change the operator we use two seperate switches. We get the answer in binary on an array of LEDS. if there is overflow or carry out, we also have seperate LEDS for this.
