In this lab we make a mock intersection on the FPGA using two RGB LEDs. We keep traffic light 1 at green for 4 seconds, then yellow for 1, then red for 7. Traffic light 2 is at red for 6 seconds, then green for 4 seconds, then yellow for 1 second, then red again for 1 second. The RGB LED is controlled using PWM signals for each of its colors (red,green,blue)
